# Forecasting-Sales

A supply chain that creates and sells video games needs to generate a forecast for the next months’ sales to plan the supply and demand for the company’s video games. We determined to build ARIMA and ETS models, and after testing them we choose the ARIMA model because has the best accuracy measures. The MASE value is significantly less 0.4532, being closer to 1 a good performance. RMSE is 33999.79, representing significantly fewer than the ETS model result. These results depict that the monthly demand for video games will be increased for the period evaluated.
